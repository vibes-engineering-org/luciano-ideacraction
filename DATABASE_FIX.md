# Database Fix for Built It Mini App

## Issue
The idea submission form was displaying "submission successful" messages, but submitted ideas were not appearing on the ideas board. This was because the application was using **localStorage** for data persistence, which meant:

1. Ideas were only stored locally in the browser
2. Data was not shared between users or devices
3. Each user only saw their own submitted ideas

## Solution
Implemented a proper shared database solution using Supabase:

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `ideas` table to store idea submissions
- Created `builds` table to store build submissions
- Added proper indexes and Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- See `supabase_schema.sql` for the complete schema

### 2. API Endpoints
- `/api/ideas` - GET/POST for ideas
- `/api/ideas/[uid]` - GET/PUT for individual ideas
- `/api/builds` - GET/POST for builds
- `/api/builds/[uid]` - GET/PUT for individual builds

### 3. Updated Functions
- Replaced localStorage functions with API calls in `src/lib/eas.ts`
- Updated `useEAS` hook to handle async data fetching
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL commands from `supabase_schema.sql`

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 3. Test the Fix
1. Submit an idea using the form
2. Check that it appears on the ideas board
3. Try from different devices/browsers to verify sharing works

## What Changed
- **Before**: Ideas stored in localStorage (device-specific)
- **After**: Ideas stored in Supabase database (shared across all users)

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/eas.ts` - Updated storage functions to use API
- `src/hooks/useEAS.ts` - Updated hook to handle async data
- `src/app/api/ideas/route.ts` - New API endpoint for ideas
- `src/app/api/ideas/[uid]/route.ts` - New API endpoint for individual ideas
- `src/app/api/builds/route.ts` - New API endpoint for builds
- `src/app/api/builds/[uid]/route.ts` - New API endpoint for individual builds
